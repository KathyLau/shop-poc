# Project Proposal

## Background and Purpose
In light of recent protests and the increased participation in the Black Lives Matter Movement, we want to create an interactive map of small, black-owned and POC-owned businesses in New York City to allow users to easily find ways to shop small and support POC businesses near them.

## Plan
We are using data from NYC Open Data, Open Source Excel sheets shared on various websites, and the Google Maps API to plot businesses on an interactive map.

## Self Building Aspect
Users of the application can give names to unnamed small businesses (not named on NYC Open data)

## Tags and photos
Users will be able to give certain tags and attribute certain photos and comments to the businesses

## Deployment Steps
1. First clone this repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/KathyLau/shop-poc

2. Make sure you have python and pip installed
3. Install requirements
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run flask app

```
5. Go on https://127.0.0.1:5000 !
